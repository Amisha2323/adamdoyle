There is not disadvantage, in a real world setting this would be a very insightful tool which makes it easier for the decision makers to see trends and correlations between dataset that are usually segmented. The plurality of sources used in this project means not only cross-referencing and deeper context in contrast to a single dataset, but also can uncover patterns that are less apparent due to isolation of the data. This configuration will enable profitable pattern, trends, information analysis and possibly, incorporation of machine learning to offer early, proactive methods like responding to customer demands, analyzing business productivity or recognizing inherent hazards.\n",
